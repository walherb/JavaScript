/* 
SVGs -> Scalable Vector Graphics
XML (aka, “Extensible Markup Language”)
xmlns - stands for “XML NameSpace”. This specifies what dialect of XML you’re using. In our case, that dialect is the SVG language spec.
viewBox - defines the bounds of your SVG
Embedding SVGs
There are two main approaches when deciding how to actually place the SVG in your document: linked, and inline.
Linking SVGs works basically the same way as linking any other image. You can use an HTML image element such as <img>, or link it in your CSS using background-image: url(./my-image.svg). They will still scale properly, but the contents of the SVG will not be accessible from the webpag
